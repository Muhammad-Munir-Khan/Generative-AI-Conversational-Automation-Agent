"""
CRITICAL isolation test for Weaviate multi-tenancy.

Run this AFTER the stack is up, from inside the api container or any environment
that can reach Weaviate, to PROVE that one user cannot see another user's docs.

This is the single most important test of the Chroma->Weaviate migration. A
multi-tenant platform that leaks documents across users is a serious security
failure. Do not trust the migration until this passes.

Usage (from the host, with the stack running):
    docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml exec api python -m app.rag.isolation_test

Or copy this file to app/rag/isolation_test.py and run as a module.
