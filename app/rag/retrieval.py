"""Vectorstore retrieval - scoped to the current user via contextvar.

Every query is routed to the current user's Weaviate tenant. Cross-tenant
reads are impossible: search_for() always passes the tenant, and the store has
multi-tenancy enabled so a missing tenant raises rather than leaking.

This module exposes two retrievers:

  retrieve(query, k)
      Personal-only. Used by document_search (agent tool) and anywhere that
      should ONLY see the user's own indexed files. Unchanged from before.

  retrieve_merged(query, k)
      Personal + global knowledge base, mixed and re-sorted by score. Used by
      the RAG endpoint (chain.rag_answer) so that turning on "RAG mode"
      surfaces both the user's documents AND admin-curated knowledge.

      Each returned Document carries an `origin` key in its metadata:
        "personal"       -> from the user's tenant
        "knowledge_base" -> from the shared global corpus
      Callers (chain.py) propagate this into SourceInfo so the UI can render
      a small badge per source.

    Strategy (chosen for fairness + predictability):

        Even when the global corpus contains thousands of objects and would
        otherwise dominate by sheer breadth, the user's own docs always get
        a fair allocation.
      - Stamp `origin` into each Document.metadata ("personal" or
        "knowledge_base") so downstream code can surface the distinction.
      - Concatenate and sort by score (higher = better). Same scoring scale
        is used by both stores (BGE embeddings + Weaviate similarity), so
        scores are directly comparable.

    Failure handling: if either store errors or is empty, we still return
