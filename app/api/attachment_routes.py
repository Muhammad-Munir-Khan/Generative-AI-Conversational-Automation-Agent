"""Attachment endpoints: extract text, optionally persist to docs. Auth required.

Beyond text extraction, the raw uploaded file is also saved into the user's
per-user workspace folder (data/repl_workspace/<user_hex>/) so that the
python_repl and csv_reader tools can find it by its original filename in
subsequent agent turns.

Upload hardening (Phase 1):
  - Size cap enforced BEFORE extraction (413 instead of reading/parsing a huge
    body).
  - Extension allowlist — only the types the extractor actually supports.
  - Magic-byte signature check for binary types (PDF/PNG/JPEG/WEBP/GIF) so a
    file can't lie about its type via the extension. Text types (txt/md/csv/tsv)
    are validated by attempting a UTF-8/latin-1 decode in the extractor.
These run after auth and the empty-file check, so an unauthenticated or empty
request is rejected first.
