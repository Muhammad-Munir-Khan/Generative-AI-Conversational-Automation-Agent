"""Async SQLAlchemy engine and session factory.

Two engines, two pools — one bound to FastAPI's main event loop (used by
async routes and the auth dependency), one bound to our background storage
loop (used by sync code via _run_sync).

Why two engines? asyncpg connections cannot be shared across event loops.
SQLAlchemy's pool keeps connections alive between requests; if those
connections were created on loop A and you try to use them from loop B,
you get the dreaded 'attached to a different loop' RuntimeError. By giving
each loop its own pool, no connection ever crosses loops.
