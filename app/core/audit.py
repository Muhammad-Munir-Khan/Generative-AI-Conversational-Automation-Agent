"""Structured audit logging for security-relevant events.

Emits one structured (JSON) line per event to a dedicated `audit` logger, so
these events can be filtered and shipped separately from normal application
logs. In Phase 2 the `audit` logger is routed to a centralized aggregator
(append-only / WORM storage) where the trail becomes tamper-evident; for now it
lands in the container's stdout alongside other logs but is cleanly
distinguishable by the `"event": "audit"` marker and the `audit` logger name.

Captured today (wired in app/core/auth.py):
  - login success / failure (bad password) / blocked (suspended)
  - registration
  - email verification request + success
  - password reset

To capture admin actions, add a one-liner at each call site in
app/api/admin_routes.py, e.g.:

    from app.core.audit import audit_event
    audit_event("user.role_change", actor=admin.email, target=user.email,
                old_role=old, new_role=new)
    audit_event("user.suspend", actor=admin.email, target=user.email)
    audit_event("user.force_logout", actor=admin.email, target=user.email)
    audit_event("kb.upload", actor=admin.email, target=source_title)
    audit_event("kb.delete", actor=admin.email, target=source_title)

Design rule: audit logging must NEVER break the request path. Every call is
wrapped so a serialization or logging error degrades to a plain log line.
