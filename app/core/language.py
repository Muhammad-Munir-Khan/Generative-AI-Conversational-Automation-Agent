"""Language utilities used across the agent, ensemble, and RAG chain.

The dropdown in the UI sends ISO-639-1 codes (e.g., "en", "ur", "ar"). We
translate those into a system-prompt directive that forces the LLM to
respond in that language and translate any English tool/document outputs.

IMPORTANT: the directive is emitted for EVERY language including English.
Earlier this returned "" for English on the assumption no instruction was
needed — but that broke mid-conversation switches: after the assistant had
been replying in (say) Japanese, switching the UI to English sent NO directive,
so the model followed the Japanese conversation history and kept answering in
Japanese. Emitting an explicit English directive (and telling the model the
current-turn language overrides earlier turns) fixes that.
