"""User roles for the admin system.

Three tiers (source of truth = the `role` column on User):
  user         - regular end user; no admin access
  corpus_admin - can manage the Global Islamic corpus (ingest, delete content)
  super_admin  - everything corpus_admin can do, PLUS user/role management

`is_superuser` (fastapi-users built-in) is kept auto-synced: a user is a
superuser iff role == super_admin. That keeps fastapi-users' own superuser
checks consistent while `role` drives our finer-grained gating.

This deliberately uses a single `role` field rather than a full
permissions table. If granular per-permission control is needed later, this
enum migrates cleanly into a roles/permissions schema without breaking the
column (the values just become role identifiers).
