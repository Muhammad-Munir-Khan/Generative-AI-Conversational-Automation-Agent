"""Tool: search the shared knowledge base (admin-curated, global).

This is the agent-facing counterpart to /admin/corpus/search. It searches the
SHARED knowledge base that admins ingest into (IslamicCorpus / global corpus),
NOT the user's personal documents. Use document_search for the user's own
files.

Design note (intentional, mirrors web_search NOT document_search):
  document_search calls rag_answer() internally - which runs another LLM
  pass to synthesize an answer from chunks before returning. That makes sense
  for personal docs because the synthesis cost is small and the answer is
  the product.

  For the KB tool we deliberately DO NOT run an inner LLM. We just return
  the top chunks (text + brief citation header) and let the agent's main
  LLM synthesize. This is faster, cheaper, and parallels how web_search
  hands back raw results for the agent to reason over.
